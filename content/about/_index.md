Howdy, I'm Ben. I am an Austin-based developer with experience in early-stage product development, algorithms, 
and machine learning. I thrive in a fast-paced work environment, working with small, dynamic teams on complex technical problems. 
Outside of work, I enjoy rock climbing, playing guitar and road trips. I am looking for new opportunities. Feel free to reach out to me via email.

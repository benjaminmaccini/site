In this post I will explore end-to-end auditable voting systems, specifically the basic principles in
their design, existing systems and then a short dive into the STAR voting system RFP in Travis County.

I even dive in, this post wouldn't be possible without Wikipedia. This could even be considered
a re-statement of the [article on end-to-end auditable voting systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_auditable_voting_systems),
with perhaps the goal of expanding certain topics that were unclear to me.

# Basics

What are the issues faced with current vote systems?
What are the requirements for a system to be verifiable?

## Cryptography Basics

Homomorphic Encryption
Mixed Nets

# Existing Systems: An overview

Helios, Wombat, Scantegrity

# STAR Voting System, Deep Dive

Why did this need to be invented?
What is the system?
Reaction and denial

I have been recently fascinated by the idea that some things either can't, don't, shouldn't, or generally suck at scale. I plan on
doing a full series on how the toxicity scale creeps into different topics, namely [Brand, Activism, Use Cases, Empathy]. Most of these posts
will be anecdotal in nature. This is a blog, email me if you want to talk about it.

This post focuses on the rift that manifests between a company's actions and their perceived brand image as it grows.

Branding is a powerful tool for individuals and small businesses to represent themselves accurately, attract clientle, and grow, but somewhere between
a small business and a corporation the brand that the company portrays becomes disconnected from the individuals and actions of the company. Examples
lie in advertising budgets, post hoc branding, etc...

I have recently signed up for a bread subscription. For 15 USD I get two loaves, delivered twice a month, of near-perfect sourdough bread from a wonderful
lady, Judith. She and her partner are immediately available for contact, prominently display not only the baking process, but also their customer interactions
come delivery day, and personally deliver the bread to your house. It is an intimate experience and being part of their community is beyond rewarding.
They don't have a public facing website, nor do they even have a logo. Simply put, they are their brand. For many small businesses, this is often the case. 
The illegal food truck chefs, the neighborhood store clerks, the local mechanics, and the bread providers all put forth a carbon copy of themselves into their brands,
their personalities reflect in the quality of experience that a customer receives.

- At this point branding is extremely helpful for starting to establish a versatile customer base (not just one type of customer (i.e. regulars)), and further solidifying
a coherent brand identity that can be communicated through whatever medium. ^[1]

My roommate works as a copywriter for an advertising firm that creates and manages brands through campaign development and creative services. 
As I sit at the kitchen table with him through quarantine, I have become quite intimate with the service they provide, particularly their
brand management. The most common scenario is what I'll call post hoc branding. In other words, when the client, often times a long established 
company, will ask the firm to construct a brand image, strategy and set of creative templates that the company can then adopt and display. Post hoc branding
is a projective
